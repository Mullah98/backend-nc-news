# Northcoders News API

My backend project utilizing SQL to design a dynamic API. To test api requests, we used Jest and Test-driven development.

Copy this link into your url and play around with the endpoints: https://nc-news-4rxh.onrender.com

To connect both databases locally, create 2 files; .env.development and .env.test. Includes PGDATABASE in both files and provide the names of the database. For eg: PGDATABASE=nc_news in the .env.development, and PGDATABASE=nc_news_test in the .env.test file.
